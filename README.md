<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

This project is for ENGT 4050 Capstone and this is our project. I am the group leader for our 6 person team. The idea of our project was to create a more sanitary solution to item delivery in the real world. This brought us to using the URe5 robotic arm along with a Raspberry PI 4 with a PI camera V2 to run the software and collect video. The main idea is to use the arm to grab and place objects and use the PI camera and Raspberry PI to scan for faces to find customers/users to know what and where to place the items. The Raspberry PI will have a database of faces which matches with an order/s so the arm knows what and where to grab and place. In this project we also created our own end effector (gripper) to grab the items.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The main setup needed is the installation of the libraries and downloading the repo as well as setting the static IP for the URe5. This project was built on a windows PC so all commands are written for it. If you are running another OS cross your fingers and knock on wood.

### Prerequisites

If you are using an IDE install the libraries through it if it has a way( Sometimes people *like me* don't link the correct python install to their IDE causing library problems). If not just run these commands in command prompt.
* PiP update (Best Practice)
  ```sh
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```
* URX
  ```sh
  pip install URX
  ```
* OpenCV
  ```sh
  pip install opencv-python
  ```
* Face Recognition
  ```sh
  pip install face_recognition
  ```
* Numpy
  ```sh
  pip install numpy
  ```

### Installation

BEFORE TRYING TO INSTALL THE REPO PLEASE INSTALL ALL LIBRARIES. Also, this install is only to be used if you are planning on directly connecting to the URe5 robotic arm. Simulation of the arm will be discussed in a later part.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jowdow/DeliveryArmCapstone
   ```
2. Open in your preferred IDE

3. Start the URe5 by pressing the power button on the teach pendant

4. Once ready the arm is ready to use navigate to the system settings
   Change the IP address of the robotic arm to whatever you would like.
   Keep in mind you will need to remeber this and this should be kept static
   unless you know what you are doing. The program does not support dynamically
   setting the IP address. 

5. Set the IP address in the program

### Simulation
There is a way to install a virtual machine of the robotic arm OS and you can test your program that way. However, I have had access to the arm enough to where this was not nessasary to do. The virtual machine [download](https://www.universal-robots.com/download/?query=sim) is dependent on what virtual machine software is being used and the host pc's operating system. Another factor is what version of the simulator you will use (Use the most up-to-date if you can).
